# Welcome!

CR-Async is an **asynchronus** CR API wrapper for Python made to be fully-featured, object oriented and easy to use.

# Installing

Install it normally from PyPI with pip:
```
pip3 install crasync
```

# Using the Wrapper

Since this is an asynchronus wrapper, the code has to be within an asynchronus function.

Some examples can be found in the [/examples](https://github.com/grokkers/cr-async/tree/master/examples) of the github repository!
